- **Lotus**, my second creation, is a website that provides functions for encryption algorithms currently in use.

- **Lotus**, is a website that allows you to create texts. You can encrypt as much text as you want. In future updates, I will explore ways to do more advanced encryption.

The encryption models used by Lotus are provided by the  **CryptoJS** and **Node-forge** library, such as:

| Algorithm   | Description                     | Usefulness |
|-------------|---------------------------------|------------|
| KDF (Key Derivation Function)        |   A Key Derivation Function (KDF) is used to derive one or more secret keys from a secret value, such as a master key, a password, or a passphrase, using a pseudo-random function. KDFs are crucial in scenarios where keys need to be generated from passwords or other non-uniform data, enhancing security by adding computational work to thwart brute-force attacks.    |✅ Very useful|
| AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)   | AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm standardized by NIST in 2001. It is widely used for secure data encryption due to its strength and efficiency. AES operates on fixed block sizes (128 bits) and supports key sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits. It's extensively used in various applications, including securing web communications, file encryption, and VPNs.       |✅ Very useful |
| RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)          |RSA is an asymmetric encryption algorithm used for secure data transmission. It was one of the first public-key cryptosystems and is widely used for secure key exchange, digital signatures, and encryption of small amounts of data. RSA relies on the computational difficulty of factoring large prime numbers, making it robust for security applications. |✅ Very useful         |
| SHA-512 (Secure Hash Algorithm)      | SHA-512 is part of the SHA-2 family, producing a 512-bit hash value. It's used for ensuring data integrity and authenticity by generating a fixed-size output from an input message, making it ideal for digital signatures, certificates, and hash-based message authentication codes (HMAC). SHA-512 is preferred for applications requiring high security due to its resistance to collisions and preimage attacks.h  |✅ Very useful     |
